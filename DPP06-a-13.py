"""Ques13. How can you create a class that inherits from another class?
 â—‹ Provide an example of inheritance in Python."""

#In Python, you can create a class that inherits from another class by specifying the parent class in parentheses after the name of the child class.
#This allows the child class to inherit all the attributes and methods of the parent class, and it can also have its own additional attributes or methods.
